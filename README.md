# Intrusion Detection System using Machine Learning
1. import the netsim file using a netsim standard 13.2 version
2. open and change the settings of the scenario according to you
3. run the simulation once and you will the metrics
4. out of which extract the battery or energy data from the metrics
5. use different time stamps to extract the data
6. make a dataset according to the extracted data
7. using any python environment to import the csv dataset 
8. run the code which consist of machine learning-deep learning algorithm 
9. evaluate the accuracy and performce of the model which tells about how well the model is able to predict malicious node
